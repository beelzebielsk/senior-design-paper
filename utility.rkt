; list? procedure? #:keep-where procedure? -> list?
; Somewhat similar to the split procedure for strings. Takes a list
; and returns a list of the same elements of lst, in the same order,
; but placed in sublists. Each sublist ends where an element occurs
; that causes (split-pred? element current-split tail) to be true. The
; next sublist picks up from there. If a split should be empty (such
; as when there are two consecutive elements that cause split-pred? to
; be true), then those splits are not kept.
; The split-map option is supplied because the output of split-where
; may not be a list of splits if the #:keep-where function returns
; 'separate. In this case, the split element is placed on it's own in
; the list of splits. Mapping over the splits (and only the splits) is
; a common enough use-case, I think, that the optional parameter is
; warranted.
; The reason why the objects at which we split are not placed in the
; list as splits is that this function takes after split-string, and
; functions like it from other languages. The thing upon which we
; split is normally removed. Not considered. There are use cases where
; you wouldn't want to throw away that which you split upon, but you'd
; want to run a function over everything else.
